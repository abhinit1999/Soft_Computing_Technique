# Speed control of induction motor using fuzzy logic :-->

                                                   ABSTRACT
Theuseof Induction motors has increased tremendously, since the day of its invention. They are being used as actuators in various industrial processes, robotics,
house appliances and other similar applications. The reason for increasing popularity day by day can be primarily attributed to its robust construction, simplicity
in design and cost of effectiveness. This paper presents a methodology for implementation of a rule-based fuzzy logic controller applied to a closed loop Volts/Hz 
speed control of induction motor. The Induction motor is modelled using a dq axis theory. The designed Fuzzy Logic Controller's performance is weighed is compared 
with that of a PIcontroller.
